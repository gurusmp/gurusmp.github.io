1. The story is based on multiple themes like love, sacrifice, hope, belief and pessimism. Which one do you think is more obvious in the story? Why? Give evidence to support your answer.
2. Why does Sue call "the last leaf" as Behrman's masterpiece? Do you think it was a masterpiece?
3. Were you surprised at the ending of the story? Did you think it would differently? Why?
4. Painting the picture on the wall resulted in Mr. Behrman's death. Do you think he would still have painted the leaf if he known that it would result in his death?
5. If you were in Sue's shoes how would you have reacted to Johnsy's irrational thoughts? Describe
6. Why do you think Mr. Behrman made such a sacrifice?
7. What would you have done if you were in Mr. Behrman's place?
8. What is the greatest sacrifice you have ever made for tour family or friends?
9. Describe Mr. Behrman's personality based on the story?
10. Why do you think Johnsy never noticed that the last leaf never fluttered or moved even though it was raining heavily?

They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in theforest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in anycase of danger.Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of themclimbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not knowhow to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down onthe ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears,and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the deadcreatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend thatwas on the ground, “Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?” Theother friend replied, “Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend”.Questions:1. What promised that they make during in the forest?2. Why did the other friend climb the nearby tree at once?3. What did the other friend do on the ground?4. Why did the bear leave the man who lying on the ground?5. “Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend”.What does the sentence above mean?

Materi ini ditujukan khususnya untuk siswa kelas 7 SMP. To be terdiri dari am, is, are sedangkan was dan were merupakan bentuk lampau-nya. Banyak yang mengartikan to be ini sebagai 'adalah' namun nyatanya to be ini tidak di artikan dalam bahasa indonesia.

I wish the following paragraphs would chronicle years of parental neglect or some sort of rare neuromuscular disorder that prevented me from pedalling, but I have no one to blame but myself. It’s not that I haven’t tried. I just can’t.
My childhood progressed like any other. Tricycles, training wheels – no problem. But the two-wheeled version proved troublesome. I would start moving just fine, but then, with the agility of a drunken trapeze artist, I would tilt, panic and put my feet down as the pedals continued rotating and slapped me in back of the legs.
It was no big deal at first. All my friends were learning, too. It’s a rite of passage. But for me this particular rite never quite seemed to pass. And when my brother – three years younger than me – started riding with all the zest of Pee-wee Herman, I realized there was a problem.
My first instinct was to hide my failure so that my friends would never know. I became a damn good rollerblader and I had a believable set of excuses on hand in the event I was ever asked to go mountain biking. I even brainwashed myself into believing in the virtues of not riding a bike. Pumping the tires, greasing the chain, locking it up everywhere you went, it all seemed like a hassle to me. And who looks good in a helmet?
But there would be one quiet Sunday every summer when I would walk my bike over to the schoolyard in secrecy, hop on, tip over and hop off, my scratched calves a strong enough deterrent until next year.
My parents took it hard. Is there a bigger mark of a failed fatherhood than a son who cannot ride a bike? At least I could throw a baseball (horribly). After years of walking alongside me, holding the back of my seat, they took drastic measures. While we were on vacation in Lake Placid, N.Y., they sought out the services of a cycling sage whose job it was to teach people to ride bikes. After three mosquito-bitten hours in the woods, he began to question his career.
Once I entered high school, my Schwinn-less abilities were largely forgotten. High school was all about showing up late, looking bored and shuffling through the halls at an irritatingly casual pace. It was, literally, the anti-bike society. I was proud to be a non-biker, shunning the punctuality, shorts and cardiovascular health that came with it. I had one friend who wanted to be a bike courier. He was largely ostracized.
I did try once more in Grade 10 after confessing my secret to a girl in a last-ditch attempt to embark on a sexual Tour de France. After an hour of calf-scratched mockery and a short trip to second base, I pulled out of the race and never opened my mouth again.
The Lance Armstrong scandal reinforced my reluctance in adulthood: I’d had a bad feeling about him from the beginning. In fact I didn’t push a pedal for the next 10 years.
I may have forgotten, but my mother never did. One hot, unsuspecting July afternoon, she couldn’t take it any more. She grabbed me, gave me her bike and sent me to the schoolyard, telling me not to leave until I’d learned.
After a bit of scrupulous surveillance to make sure no one was in sight, I climbed aboard the beast – a women’s bike that was three sizes too small. I launched into strategic warfare with my childhood and my decade-dormant equilibrium. Should I pedal first? Push and then pedal? Did I still have the training wheels in the garage?
After an hour and a half of scratched calves, internal tantrums and the threat of testicular atrophy from the female crossbar, I finally started to go. Five seconds at first, then I panicked and tipped over, but I turned around and started again. Ten seconds, 20 seconds and then a full minute without kissing pavement. I felt a rush of fresh new air in my lungs, a breath that was a little more complete. I am sure my cries of “Hey! Hey! Look at this!” drew more than a few neighbours to their windows to see an overgrown man’s low-budget re-enactment of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.
Did this newfound skill start a renaissance of childlike wonder and being? Absolutely not. In fact, I still absolutely suck. I have difficulty steering, and mastering the brakes might take me another 25 years.
But I did learn one thing: Your successes don’t define you, your failures do. Embrace your failures – they keep you going. If we only had successes we’d have nothing to live for. And if you can’t quite crack the code, put it down, but never walk away, even if it takes you 10 years. It’s just like riding a bike.</a>

                                            Read the text to answer questions 1 to 3.The sugar glider is a marsupial, just like the many other Australian animals – the kangaroo, the koala and the wombat for instance. The sugar glider is a possum – very similar to the tupai in Indonesia. It basically lives in trees. It eats leaves and fruit. However, the Australian sugar glider has a very special skill. It can jump from tree to tree like a tupai but it can also `sort of fly’ as well. In fact, it glides or terbang layang in Bahasa Indonesia. When it jumps from one tree to another it spreads its four legs out wide; and its extra skin also spreads out and functions like a parachute.1. What does the text tell us about?…A.  The kangaroo B.

But, be careful if it is wounded with a gun or the mother bear and her cubs are shocked. Some hunters claim the brown bear can outfight a tiger. A grown brownie may be up to nine feet tall. It may weigh over 1,600 pounds. But home when the brown bear is born, it weighs less than one pound. If you grew at the same rate, you would weigh almost 10,000 pounds when you were fully grown!4.

They lived from about 230 million to about 65 million years ago. In 1842, Sir Richard Owen created the word dinosaur. It came from Greek words deinos, meaning “terrible” and sauros, meaning “lizard”. Dinosaurs lived on earth for about 140 million years.During the dinosaurian era, the days were short. The sun was not as hot as it is today. On earth there was only one big continent and one big ocean. The name of the continent was pangea (all lands) and the name of the ocean was panthallassa (all seas).There were many kinds of dinosaurs. Some of them were very big and some others were small. Some dinosaurs ate leaves and some others ate meat. Some dinosaurs could fly.What happened to dinosaurs? Dinosaurs became extinct because there was a large comet hitting the earth. The comet caused fire and it killed the trees. Dinosaurs could not eat because there were no trees on earth and finally they died and became extinct.7. What were the days like during the dinosaurian era?A.  LongB.  ColdC.  WarmD.  Short8.

Dia bekerja sebagai pelayan bagi mereka dan memenuhi setiap kebutuhan mereka.  Dia melakukan semua memasak dan membersihkan, dan diperlakukan seperti pelayan.  Kakak tiri itu sangat kejam.  Ketika Pangeran Desa mengirimkan undangan ke pesta dansa yang diadakan untuk menghormatinya kepada semua penduduk desa, Cinderella memohon untuk pergi tetapi ibu tirinya tidak mengizinkannya.  Malam pesta dansa tiba, dan saudara perempuan serta ibu tertawa dan pergi.  Cinderella menangis dan berharap dia bisa hadir juga.  Saat itu Ibu Peri-nya muncul dan menggunakan sihirnya agar Cinderella bisa hadir, memberinya gaun, sandal kaca, dan mengubah labu menjadi kereta.  Dia juga memberi tahu Cinderella bahwa mantra ini hanya akan bertahan sampai tengah malam Cinderella pergi ke pesta dansa dan ketika dia di sana dia menarik sedikit perhatian terutama dari Pangeran.  Keduanya menari sepanjang malam, sampai Cinderella mendengar jam berbunyi.  Dia ingat apa yang dikatakan ibu baptisnya, dan berlari pergi, hanya menyisakan sandal.  Pangeran yang putus asa untuk menemukan wanita misterius ini meminta asistennya pergi ke semua wanita di desa untuk menemukan pemiliknya.  Tepat ketika semua harapan hilang, asisten itu mencoba sipper di langkah saudara perempuan dan meskipun berusaha keras, sepatu itu tidak muat.  Cinderella kemudian mencoba sepatu itu dan sepatu itu sangat cocok untuk mengejutkan semua orang, terutama saudara tirinya dan ibu tirinya yang jahat.  Cinderella menikahi Pangeran Tampan dan hidup bahagia selamanya.<br />

                            36. Hello everyone, how are you today? hopefully you are always fine.Pada kesempatan ini kami akan memberikan materi penggunaan to be dalam bahasa inggris. Materi ini ditujukan khususnya untuk siswa kelas 7 SMP. To be terdiri dari am, is, are sedangkan was dan were merupakan bentuk lampau-nya. Banyak yang mengartikan to be ini sebagai 'adalah' namun nyatanya to be ini tidak di artikan dalam bahasa indonesia.

                            37. Yang pandai bahasa Inggris, tolong terjemahkan ini ke bhs. Indonesia ya?penting banget soalnya.
I wish the following paragraphs would chronicle years of parental neglect or some sort of rare neuromuscular disorder that prevented me from pedalling, but I have no one to blame but myself. It’s not that I haven’t tried. I just can’t.
My childhood progressed like any other. Tricycles, training wheels – no problem. But the two-wheeled version proved troublesome. I would start moving just fine, but then, with the agility of a drunken trapeze artist, I would tilt, panic and put my feet down as the pedals continued rotating and slapped me in back of the legs.
It was no big deal at first. All my friends were learning, too. It’s a rite of passage. But for me this particular rite never quite seemed to pass. And when my brother – three years younger than me – started riding with all the zest of Pee-wee Herman, I realized there was a problem.
My first instinct was to hide my failure so that my friends would never know. I became a damn good rollerblader and I had a believable set of excuses on hand in the event I was ever asked to go mountain biking. I even brainwashed myself into believing in the virtues of not riding a bike. Pumping the tires, greasing the chain, locking it up everywhere you went, it all seemed like a hassle to me. And who looks good in a helmet?
But there would be one quiet Sunday every summer when I would walk my bike over to the schoolyard in secrecy, hop on, tip over and hop off, my scratched calves a strong enough deterrent until next year.
My parents took it hard. Is there a bigger mark of a failed fatherhood than a son who cannot ride a bike? At least I could throw a baseball (horribly). After years of walking alongside me, holding the back of my seat, they took drastic measures. While we were on vacation in Lake Placid, N.Y., they sought out the services of a cycling sage whose job it was to teach people to ride bikes. After three mosquito-bitten hours in the woods, he began to question his career.
Once I entered high school, my Schwinn-less abilities were largely forgotten. High school was all about showing up late, looking bored and shuffling through the halls at an irritatingly casual pace. It was, literally, the anti-bike society. I was proud to be a non-biker, shunning the punctuality, shorts and cardiovascular health that came with it. I had one friend who wanted to be a bike courier. He was largely ostracized.
I did try once more in Grade 10 after confessing my secret to a girl in a last-ditch attempt to embark on a sexual Tour de France. After an hour of calf-scratched mockery and a short trip to second base, I pulled out of the race and never opened my mouth again.
The Lance Armstrong scandal reinforced my reluctance in adulthood: I’d had a bad feeling about him from the beginning. In fact I didn’t push a pedal for the next 10 years.
I may have forgotten, but my mother never did. One hot, unsuspecting July afternoon, she couldn’t take it any more. She grabbed me, gave me her bike and sent me to the schoolyard, telling me not to leave until I’d learned.
After a bit of scrupulous surveillance to make sure no one was in sight, I climbed aboard the beast – a women’s bike that was three sizes too small. I launched into strategic warfare with my childhood and my decade-dormant equilibrium. Should I pedal first? Push and then pedal? Did I still have the training wheels in the garage?
After an hour and a half of scratched calves, internal tantrums and the threat of testicular atrophy from the female crossbar, I finally started to go. Five seconds at first, then I panicked and tipped over, but I turned around and started again. Ten seconds, 20 seconds and then a full minute without kissing pavement. I felt a rush of fresh new air in my lungs, a breath that was a little more complete. I am sure my cries of “Hey! Hey! Look at this!” drew more than a few neighbours to their windows to see an overgrown man’s low-budget re-enactment of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.
Did this newfound skill start a renaissance of childlike wonder and being? Absolutely not. In fact, I still absolutely suck. I have difficulty steering, and mastering the brakes might take me another 25 years.
But I did learn one thing: Your successes don’t define you, your failures do. Embrace your failures – they keep you going. If we only had successes we’d have nothing to live for. And if you can’t quite crack the code, put it down, but never walk away, even if it takes you 10 years. It’s just like riding a bike.</h2><br />

Read the text to answer questions 1 to 3.The sugar glider is a marsupial, just like the many other Australian animals – the kangaroo, the koala and the wombat for instance. The sugar glider is a possum – very similar to the tupai in Indonesia. It basically lives in trees. It eats leaves and fruit. However, the Australian sugar glider has a very special skill. It can jump from tree to tree like a tupai but it can also `sort of fly’ as well. In fact, it glides or terbang layang in Bahasa Indonesia. When it jumps from one tree to another it spreads its four legs out wide; and its extra skin also spreads out and functions like a parachute.1. What does the text tell us about?…A.  The kangaroo B.

But, be careful if it is wounded with a gun or the mother bear and her cubs are shocked. Some hunters claim the brown bear can outfight a tiger. A grown brownie may be up to nine feet tall. It may weigh over 1,600 pounds. But home when the brown bear is born, it weighs less than one pound. If you grew at the same rate, you would weigh almost 10,000 pounds when you were fully grown!4.

They lived from about 230 million to about 65 million years ago. In 1842, Sir Richard Owen created the word dinosaur. It came from Greek words deinos, meaning “terrible” and sauros, meaning “lizard”. Dinosaurs lived on earth for about 140 million years.During the dinosaurian era, the days were short. The sun was not as hot as it is today. On earth there was only one big continent and one big ocean. The name of the continent was pangea (all lands) and the name of the ocean was panthallassa (all seas).There were many kinds of dinosaurs. Some of them were very big and some others were small. Some dinosaurs ate leaves and some others ate meat. Some dinosaurs could fly.What happened to dinosaurs? Dinosaurs became extinct because there was a large comet hitting the earth. The comet caused fire and it killed the trees. Dinosaurs could not eat because there were no trees on earth and finally they died and became extinct.7. What were the days like during the dinosaurian era?A.  LongB.  ColdC.  WarmD.  Short8.
